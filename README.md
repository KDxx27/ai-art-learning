# AI Art & Generative AI Learning

This repository documents my learning journey in AI-assisted art creation, focused on 2D assets for games.

## Tools & Areas of Exploration
- Generative AI (Stable Diffusion based platforms)
- Prompt engineering for visual generation
- Image refinement using Photoshop / Photopea
- Understanding composition, lighting, and color for game art

## Objective
To explore how AI-generated visuals can be refined and aligned with professional artistic standards in game development.
